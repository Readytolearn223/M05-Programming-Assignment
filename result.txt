What my test result mean to me  is that  it keep's track of  all my test's ,which means that it 
is keepimg track of how many times I ran the test and the timing of how long it takes for
the test to be completed.At the same time my test result can also tell me which  test's has failed,
which allow's me to go back in my code and fix the test's that were having issues.
